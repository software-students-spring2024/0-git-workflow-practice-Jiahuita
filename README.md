## My Reflection
I am interested in this article because it is discussing about the possibilities of how AI could help in making software development process more efficient.  It is not only interesting to see how amazing AI could help us in certain tasks, but also important for us to realize what is more important to learn nowadays to develop skill sets to utilize AI as a tool and improve our competitiveness as a software engineer of the new era.

## Comments

I really appreciate how the article goes more into depth about the practical usage of AI and for the time being, what I would consider the correct usage of AI. Having AI does not mean we can input a problem and expect a fully correct and bug free output. AI is not that advanced YET, but in the mean time, we can still utilize it to help us with other tasks that the article briefly covers, like:
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Speeding up development/test cycles
- Reducing software maintenance costs
- etc.
